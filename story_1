I am going to be honest, I didnt do much besides completly school asignments and doing various chores around the house.
Though to be blunt: the fact that *NONE* of the assignments given so far by any of my teachers have had clear instructions is a pain
How do you expect me to learn anything when i have to resort to using google to figure out what your want from me.
that doesnt exactly speak highly of ones ability to teach or the usefulness of this platform for teaching or sharing code.
Besides doing that i had some fun playing videogames and talking to one of my friends which had been quite sick with 
toncilities the past few days meaning he had effectivly been bedridden and his parents......well lets just say they arnt the nicest people
and i dont plan to be putting much effort into these assignments because the school website has shown that these assignments arnt going 
to affect our grade when it comes to graduation or moving onto post secondary, so im only trying these assignments to be 
'polite' and 'learn something' since my parents wont let me not do them
and you really could work on how were supposed to hand things in from here
